To run all the General Interface tests, launch gi-jsunit.html
in the browser to test. Then click the "Run" button.

To add a new test suite, create a new JavaScript file in the tests/
directory. Define the tests to run with the gi.test.jsunit.defineTests
method. Finally, add a reference to the new JavaScript test file in the
tests/suite.js file.

This test suite can also be run from an HTTP server.
