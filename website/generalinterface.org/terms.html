Thank you for your interest in The Dojo Foundation (the Foundation"). By using
the General Interface web site (http://www.generalinterface.org), You accept
and agree to the following terms and conditions for Your Contributions to the
Dojo Foundation (the Foundation). In return, the Foundation shall not use Your
Contributions in a way that is contrary to the public benefit or inconsistent

title, and interest in and to Your Contributions.
<p/>

"You" (or "Your") shall mean the copyright owner or legal entity authorized by
the copyright owner that is making this Agreement with the Foundation. For
legal entities, the entity making a Contribution and all other entities that
control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that entity are
considered to be a single Contributor. For the purposes of this definition,
"control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or
management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii)
ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii)
beneficial ownership of such entity. 
<p/>
"Contribution" shall mean any original work of authorship, including any
modifications or additions to an existing work, that is intentionally
submitted by You to the Foundation for inclusion in, or documentation of, any
of the products owned or managed by the Foundation (the "Work"). For the
purposes of this definition, "submitted" means the electronic communication
sent to the Foundation or its representatives including but not limited to
communication on General Interface's forums, wikis that are managed by, or on
behalf of the Foundation for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work,
but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
designated in writing by You as "Not a Contribution."
<p/>
2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, You hereby grant to the Foundation and to recipients of software

make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the
Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by You
that are necessarily infringed by Your Contribution alone or by combination of
Your Contribution with the Work to which such Contribution was submitted, as
the Work existed at the time of Your Contribution. If any entity institutes
patent litigation against You or any other entity (including a cross-claim or
counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that your Contribution, or the Work to
which you have contributed, constitutes direct or contributory patent
infringement, then any patent licenses granted to that entity under this
Agreement for that Contribution or Work shall terminate as of the date such
litigation is filed.
